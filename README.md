    Help MacGyver to escape!
 </h2>

## Features
There is only a single level. The structure (departure, location of walls, arrival), must be registered in a file to modify her easily at the need. MacGyver will be controlled by the directional touches of the keyboard.:arrow_left: :arrow_up: :arrow_right: :arrow_down:  

Objects will be randomly distributed in the labyrinth and will change location if the user closes the game and relaunching.   

The window of the game will be a square which can display 15 sprites on the length.

MacGyver will thus have to move of square in square, with 15 square on the length of the window!

Hewill get back an object simply by moving above.

The program stops only if MacGyver got back well all the objects and found the exit of the labyrinth. If he has all the objects and  pr√©sent in front of the guard, he dies (the life is cruel for the heroes).

The program will be standalone, that is he can be executed on any computer.

## Constraints
- Versioning your code by using Git and to publish him on Github so that your mentor can comment on it
- To respect the best practice of the PEP 8 and will develop in a virtual environment using Python 3
- The code must be written in English: name of variables, comments, functions...

## Skills to validate
- Read and understand a documentation of module
- Code effectively by using the adequate tools
- Use an algorithm to solve a technical need
- Manage the various versions of Python and its modules according to the projects
- Conceptualize its whole application by describing its structure (Entities / Domain Objects)
- Create scripts for Web by using Python
